A quick (example) adaptor for the php eval server.
Offers a higher level api as a gen_server, and a thrift server.
Has one method: whocares(Type, Id) which returns a list of ints.

You will need to compile the erlang thrift libs and edit the path in go.sh
and include an implementation of whocares() php function or change accordingly.
